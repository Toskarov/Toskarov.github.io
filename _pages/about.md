Hi! I'm Raúl Lleida and this is my portfolio, although I prefer to call it my little corner of notes, where I can keep them handy at all times. And while I'm at it, why not share them with the world?

**So, just a heads-up:** Everything I publish here will have a casual tone, not because I don't know how to be formal, but because this blog is a piece of me.

## Meet me a little bit
The truth is, I'm just an ordinary guy. I developed my passion for computers since I was young, thanks to a computer we had at home. I played with it until I literally made it explode =)

It was thanks to this event that I decided to learn more and become a professional in this wonderful world. Although, to be honest, what really fascinates me is hacking. After all, to breach systems, one must understand how they operate. In other words, to understand why my computer exploded, I need to grasp its functioning.

As time passed, I completed:
- **Vocational Training** (Grado Medio)
- **Higher Vocational Training** (Grado Superior)
- **Master's in Cybersecurity from UNIR**

Yet, I still feel I need to keep learning and improving. That's why I started this blog—to have you accompany me on this journey.

## What you'll find here
Here you'll find a couple of tabs:
- **Portfolio**
	- Where I will publish topics related to cybersecurity
- **Blog**
	- Where I will publish topics related to systems or anything else could be useful to have stored
- **Scripts**
	- Here I want to publish the scripts I create. While it's true that [GitHub](www.github.com) exist for this purpose, here I can provide a more extensive and casual explanation of the code. 
- **HTB**
	- It's not created yet, but here I will publish my step-by-step guides for [HTB's](https://www.hackthebox.com/) breached machines. I have completed a few machines and documented the process, but I aim to revisit and document them more thoroughly
- **Certifications**
	- This tab will take some time to be created. I'm seriously thinking about getting a certification, specifically the [Practical Junior Penetration Tester (PJPT)](https://certifications.tcm-sec.com/pjpt/). Also, I think it might be interesting to create a blog where I can write about what I'm learning, or when I get certified, write about what it means to me and give a couple of tips in case anyone needs them.
- **CV**
	- Here you will find my Curriculum Vitae in case you want to take a look =)
